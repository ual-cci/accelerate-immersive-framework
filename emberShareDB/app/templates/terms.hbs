  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Try to keep Your comments relevant and stick to the topic under discussion; there are many general social networking sites and forums around – The Mimic Project Website is not one of these.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Be civil and don't say anything on The Mimic Project Website You wouldn't say in a face to face conversation – and remember that online statements can easily be misinterpreted as there aren’t non-‐verbal cues to clarify what is intended.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Be tolerant of the behaviour of other The Mimic Project Website Users and assume they will generally be acting in good faith.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">When commenting on Submissions made by other Users try to use praise and constructive criticism. Avoid making negative comments about the efforts of other Users. Some examples of different types of “praise” and “criticism” are given below.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">It is not wrong to disagree with another User, but when doing so reply to the argument -‐ do not make personal attacks. In many cases, You will be arguing about opinions and there may be no objectively right answer. Remember that other Users have different thoughts and beliefs to You and that they may be just as passionate as You are about defending these.</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Do not in any circumstances make defamatory, false or prejudiced statements, and do not bully, make “trolling” comments or otherwise provoke other Users.</span></li>

  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Evaluative Praise: “Sick”, “Nice one”;</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Descriptive Praise: “Great use of a for loop in your program.”;</span></li>
  <li class="li3"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Constructive Praise: “The program you wrote was really interesting but it would be even better if you tried to use a for loop instead of having all those similar looking lines of code. ”</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">“Criticism” can be defined as a: ‘ Negative expression of disapproval’ – e.g.:</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Evaluative Criticism: “That was bad”, “You are bad”;</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Descriptive Criticism: “That was bad because You are using the wrong coding techmique”;</span></li>
  <li class="li1"><span class="s3"></span><span class="s1">Constructive Criticism: “The for loop wasn’t as good as it could be – I wonder if You could use a while loop?”</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Please try to use Praise when commenting on Submissions from other Users. If You are going to use Criticism, please try to ensure it is Constructive Criticism; avoid Descriptive or Evaluative Criticism.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The Mimic Project Website Community Guidelines v1.2<br>
© Goldsmiths’ College 2014-‐15 -‐ last amended 25th March 2017.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The Mimic Project Website</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">GUIDE TO COPYRIGHT AND MORAL RIGHTS</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">DISCLAIMER</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The following guide is intended as a basic guide to copyright and moral rights – it is not intended to and does not constitute formal legal advice. We cannot accept any liability in relation to any reliance You may place on the information<br>
contained in this guide; You are advised to consult a suitably-‐qualified lawyer or other professional if You need formal legal advice about copyright and related issues.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Although copyright law is to some extent standardised internationally, details vary in different jurisdictions; this guide is based on the position under English law.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">DEFINITION OF COPYRIGHT</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The term “copyright” describes the rights that an owner of copyright in a particular work has to control how the work is used. Under UK law, copyright applies to the following types of original work: * literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; * sound recordings, films and broadcasts; * the typographical arrangement of published editions.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">A “literary work” includes a table or compilation, a computer programme, and a database; a “dramatic work” includes a work of dance or mime.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Copyright does not apply to ideas as such, but only to ideas once they are given material expression through one of the above types of work. Copyright arises automatically, it does not need to be registered (though there are advantages of doing so in some jurisdictions. You cannot assume that a work is not subject to copyright just because it does not display a visible © symbol.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">A single piece of work may have multiple copyrights which can be owned by different people. For example, a pop song may have separate copyrights in the lyrics, the music and the sound recording. Any use of that song would require permission from all of the copyright owners.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">RIGHTS OF A COPYRIGHT OWNER</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The owner of copyright in a work has a number of exclusive rights in relation to that work, namely: * to copy the work; * to issue copies of the work to the public; * to rent or lend the work to the public; * to perform, show or play the work in public;<br>
* to communicate the work to the public; * to make an adaptation of the work or do any of the above in relation to an adaptation.<br>
With a few limited exceptions it is an infringement of copyright to do any of the above to a copyright work (or a substantial part thereof) without the permission of the copyright owner. In the case of joint ownership of copyright, permission is required from all copyright owners. As described above, where a single piece of work such as a pop song is subject to multiple copyrights, permission is required from all of the owners of all of the different copyrights.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">OWNERSHIP OF COPYRIGHT</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Generally, the first owner of copyright in a work is the author or authors (unless the work is created by an employee in the course of their duties) though that copyright will often be licensed or assigned to a third party– e.g. to record companies or music publishers.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">It is generally easy to understand who the author is of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work. In the case of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work which is computer-‐generated, the author shall be taken to be the person by whom the arrangements necessary for the creation of the work are undertaken.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">In relation to other copyright works, the author or authors are deemed to be: * In the case of a sound recording, the producer; * In the case of a film, the producer and the principal director; * In the case of a broadcast, the person making the original broadcast;<br>
* In the case of the typographical arrangement of a published edition, the publisher.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">DURATION OF COPYRIGHT</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The duration of copyright varies in different jurisdictions and in relation to different types of copyright work. In the UK the most important are as follows: * literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works – 70 years from the end of the calendar year in which the last author dies. (If a work is computer-‐ generated copyright expires 50 years from the end of the calendar year in which the work was made). * sound recordings – 50 years from the year of recording, or of publication or communication to the public (if later); * films -‐ 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the death of the last to die of the principal director, the author of the screenplay, the author of the dialogue, or the composer of music specially created for and used in the film; * the typographical arrangement of published editions – 25 years from the calendar year in which the edition was first published.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">There are further rules that govern the duration of copyright when the author or authors are unknown, or when the authors come from outside an EE state. This is outside the scope of this guide.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Wikipedia has more information on copyright term lengths here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries'_copyright_lengths<br>
</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">MORAL RIGHTS</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Many jurisdictions also recognise what are termed “moral rights”. In the UK these are:<br>
* The right to be identified as the author or director of a copyright work; * The right to object to derogatory treatment of a work; * The right to object to false attribution of a work; * The right to privacy of certain photographs and films commissioned for private and domestic purposes.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">Moral rights cannot be assigned, so remain with the author or director (or their estate); moral rights can however be waived.</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">AVOIDING COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT</span></p>
<p class="terms-text"><span class="s1">The easiest way to avoid copyright infringement is to ensure that all of Your Submissions to The Mimic Project Website are original. Otherwise, You need to be sure that You either have the permission of all the relevant copyright owners (which would normally take the form of a formal copyright licence), or that all the relevant copyright terms have expired. If You are not sure – please don’t make the Submission!</span></p>
