    "Musically Intelligent Machines Interacting Creatively" is an AHRC-funded project to develop a web platform for the exploration of Musical Machine Learning and Listening. We have specifically designed this platform as an interactive coding environment, engineered to help bring new technologies in AI and signal processing to artists, composers, musicians and performers all over the world.
    </p>
    <p id = "about-text">
      Our platform already has built in audio DSP, Machine Listening and Machine Learning tools to make it easier to get started, as well as examples of how to integrate external Machine Learning systems for Sound, Music and Art making.
    </p>
    <p id = "about-text">
      Over the next three years, we aim to integrate brand new and developing creative systems into this platform so that they can be more easily used by musicians and artists in the creation of entirely new music, sound, and media, enabling people to understand and apply new computational techniques such as Machine Learning in their own creative work.
