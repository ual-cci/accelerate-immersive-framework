# MIMIC Code Editor 

## To run locally:

Install Mongo, Node.js, npm, Bower (will look to remove this in future)

Install Ember CLI
```
npm install -g ember-cli
```

The project contains two folders, one for the ember frontend and one for the node server

### in "nodeServer"

* The ports and IP addresses are pulled in from an external config file, this is not committed as it may contain sensitive info (e.g. mongo logins etc...)

* You should create a file called config.js in this directory with the following structure (and your own details). Do not commit this to the repository. 

```javascript

module.exports = {
    emberIP : "localhost",
    emberPort : 4200,
    serverIP : "localhost",
    serverPort : 8080,
    mongoIP: "localhost",
    mongoPort : 27017,
    contentDBName : 'content',
    contentCollectionName : 'docs',
    oauthDBName: 'oauth'
}

```

Then run 
```
npm install 
```
and 
```
node server
```

### in "emberShareDB"

* The config for this project is stored in config->environment.js

* You should edit the details for 

```javascript

ENV.contentDBName = 'docs';
ENV.oauthHost = "http://localhost:8080/oauth";
ENV.serverHost = "http://localhost:8080";
ENV.wsHost = "ws://localhost:8080";
```

PLEASE ONLY DO THIS FOR DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT

Then run 
```
npm install
bower install
```

and 
```
ember s
```
